Hi there! My name is Sai Divvela. I am an undergraduate at the University of Maryland double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My interestes generally span the intersection of programming languages, systems and security. I am passionate about applying techniques from the field of programming languages towards emerging computer systems and architectures. Additionally, I have a strong interest in type theories, program logics, and semantics.

I am planning to apply for PhD programs in the 2026-2027 cycle.
