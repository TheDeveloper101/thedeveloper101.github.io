Hi there! My name is Sai Divvela. I am an undergraduate at the University of Maryland double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My interestes generally span the intersection of programming languages, systems and security. I am passionate about applying techniques from the field of programming languages towards emerging computer systems and architectures. I also have a strong interest in type theories, program logics, and logical relations.
