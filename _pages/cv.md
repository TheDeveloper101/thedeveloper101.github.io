Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Maryland, 2027 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Spring 2024 - Spring 2025, Fall 2025 - Present: Programming Languages Research Assistant at UMD
  * Developed novel type system based on typestate principles to prevent energy usage bugs in intermittent devices
  * Enabled type system to reason about energy usage in intermittent systems to prevent device bricking bugs
  * Created core calculus to model driver behavior, and developed a type checking tool in Rust to run on TockOS HAL
  * Proved the type system prevents device bricking bugs and only allows correct programs to be compiled

* Summer 2025: Reed Research Fellow
  * Analyzed effects of context switching for caches, proved that gaining additional memory results in optimal performance
  * Improved worst case time bounds for cache adaptive algorithms by 50%
  * Proved that initial contents of a cache do not affect the asymptotic performance of common caching strategies

* Summer 2023: JHU Student Researcher
  * Worked to develop an ML algorithm for classifying signals in Python that have poor signal-to-noise ratios by utilizing Independent Component Analysis and Neural Networks
  * Created training data by utilizing a bootstrapping method to create signals which were statistically similar to experiments

* Summer 2022 - Spring 2023: Intern/Visiting Student at HEMI, JHU
  * Designed and developed algorithm in Python and GMSH to generate models of different materials for use in phase-field simulations under the supervision of a postdoctoral researcher
  * Allowed algorithm interface with experimental data to generate accurate models

* Spring 2022 - Spring 2023: Developer at Monarch Events
  * Developed account management system for users to interact with tournament management software ensuring users can log in securely and passwords are protected
  * Migrated company libraries and frameworks from Python to Rust, increasing speed by about 30% and reducing latency and technical debt 

Projects
======
* SnaKT Verifier: Worked to enhance type system for Kotlin to enable formal verification of programs. Improved precision of Kotlin to Viper translation to verify more programs such as linked lists 
* faer Linear Algebra Library: Added vectorization within various linear algebra primitives to improve performance by 1.5-2x from baseline, and outperforming industry standard solvers on certain benchmarks
* Autovectorization in Rust: Working on adding language support for autovectorization

Service and leadership
======
* MatLab tutor for Math department (Spring 2025 to present)
* Undergraduate member of CS Education Committee (Fall 2025 - Spring 2026)
* Co-founder and organizer of undergraduate Programming Language Theory Club (Fall 2024 to present)
